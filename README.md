Original data source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

The following files are coming from the source zip file:  
 * activity_label.txt -> list of activity labels  
 * features.txt -> list of recorded measures  
 * features_info.txt -> description of the measures  
 * README.txt -> description of the files from the source data  
 * directories test and train -> contains the measure files

Specific files created for the project:  
 * README.md -> this file  
 * CodeBook.md -> explains the run_analysis.R script file  
 * run_analysis.R -> code file  
 * tidyDataSet.txt -> resulting dataset uploaded on the Coursera site  

To be able to replay the analysis file, run the run_analysis.R script in the root directory of the data extracted from the original zip file (where the files activity_label.txt and the features.txt files are located).  

Check the CodeBook.md file for the complete description of the run_analysis.R script.
